What Is Data
------------

"Data are values of qualitative or quantitative varibales, belonging to a set of items" (wikipedia)

*set of items* = sometimes called "the population" : is the set of objects you are interested in, set of things (or people) you're going to make measurements on

*variables* = measurements or characteristics of an item

*qualitative* = origin, sex, country etc. : not necessarily ordered, not necessarily measurements

*quantitative* = usually measured on continuous scale (ec. height, weight, blood pressure) and usually ordered on that scale

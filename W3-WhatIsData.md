What Is Data
------------

> "Data are values of qualitative or quantitative varibales, belonging to a set of items" (wikipedia)

*set of items* = sometimes called "the population" : is the set of objects you are interested in, set of things (or people) you're going to make measurements on

*variables* = measurements or characteristics of an item

*qualitative* = origin, sex, country etc. : not necessarily ordered, not necessarily measurements

*quantitative* = usually measured on continuous scale (ec. height, weight, blood pressure) and usually ordered on that scale

### What do data look like ?

It could be a file not formatted, APIs, medical records not formatted, videos, audio files, raw text files, excel files (very rare at the beginning of the study!!!)

*Data* are the **second** most important thing in data science. **The Most important thing in data analysis is *THE QUESTION* ** : data should follow the question

Often data will limit or enable the question you're trying to ask : having data can't save you if you don't have a question

**The key is focusing on the question and not being driven by the fact that you have data**

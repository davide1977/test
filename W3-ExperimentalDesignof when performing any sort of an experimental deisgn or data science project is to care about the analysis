Experimental Design
---

Basics to get started :

Why you should care about experimental design ?

* Exemple study : Genomic signatures to guide the use of chemoterapeutics

The first thing to be aware of when performing any sort of an experimental deisgn or data science project is to care about the analysis plan

To share your data with small amounts, GitHub is ok

For larger amounts, you might go on *Figshare.com*

Recomendation of a data plan : The Leek group guide to data sharing available here: https://github.com/jtleek/datasharing

* The First thing you need when you perform an experiment is **formulate your question in advance** (exemple AB testing Barack Obama campaign)

This bring sus to the key idea of a large component of data science which is statistical inference : http://www.gs.washington.edu/academics/courses/akey/56008/lecture/lecture2.pdf

THey use inferential statistics to decide if implement new versions :

3 scenarios of results :

Scenario 1 very variable answer

Scenario 2 :  smaller variability but without huge benefit

Scenario 3 : SMall variability and huge difference in benefit

Another important issue, is the issue of Confounding :

in a particural study you mesure both shoe size and literacy, and you are looking for correlation between shoe size and literacy, and you can find a correlation: people with smallshoes tend to have less literacy

But you are missing that AGE is actually the variable that's causing this relationship!!! (Babies have less literacy!!!) : *pay attention to what are the other variables that might be causing a relationship!*

Real exemple : consumption of chocolate vs Nobel prize laureate!! 

This is often called "Spurious correlation" and that's why you have often the phrase "correlation is not causation"

Why to deals with potential confounders :

1 Fix some variables

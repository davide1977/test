## Types od Data Science Questions

### In (Approximate) order of difficulty

* Descriptive

* Exploratory

* Inferential

* Predictive

* Causal

* Mechanistic

### Descriptive

The goal is to describe a set of data (most commonly applied to census data)

>> Description and interpretation are differents steps

Description can usually not be generalized without additional statistical modeling

Exemple : Google Ngram Viewer / American Census website / 

### Exploratory

The goal is to find relationship that you didn't know previously

Good for discovering new connections or definine future studies

They are not final say and not should be used to generalize or predict

CORRELATION DOES NOT IMPLY CAUSATION!

Exemple :  Analysis on effect on brain of certains stimuli

### Inferential

Goal : When you try to take a small amount of data on a small of small number of observation and try to generalize to a larger population

Inference is the most common goal of statistical models and involves estimating both THE QUANTITY YOU CARE ABOUT and YOUR UNCERTAINITY about your estimate and depends HEAVILY on both de population your are studying and the sampling scheme

Exemple : "Effect of Air Pollution Control on Life Expectancy" (did on 545 Counties of US...)... etc.

### Predictive

More challenging than Inferential analysis

Goal : Use data on some object to predict values for another object

Attention! Even if X predicts Y does not mean that X causes Y

Predictions depends HEAVILY on measuring the RIGHT variables!

Although there are better and worse prediction models, more data and a simple model works really well...!!!

Predictions is very hard especially about the future (joke!)

Examples : five thirty eight Forecast Blog / https://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2012/02/16/how-target-figured-out-a-teen-girl-was-pregnant-before-her-father-did/#17790bfc6668

### Causal

Goal : what happens to one variable when you make another variable change

The gold standard for doing this in general is using randomized studies or randomized controlled trials to identify causation

Casually relationship are usually identified as average effects, may not be applied to every individual

Casual models are the "gold standard" for data analysis

Exemples : ...

### Mechanistic

Goal : Understand the exact changes in variables that lead to changes in other variables for individual objects

Very hard to infer, except in very simple situation

Application is normally in physical/engineering science

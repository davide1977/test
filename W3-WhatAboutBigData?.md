It depends on your perspective : the definition of big data is changing with the size of data availables

So Why is such a big deal ? (exempleon "6 degrees of separation" experiment with whatsapp or by letter in 1969...): you can collect much more data and much more *cheaply*

But normally, you can analyze a bug amount of data on your computer (not possible with big data) without having to get into more complicated techniques needed for scaling up to massive size of data... And regardless the size of your data, you need then *right* data... 

> The data might not contain the answer.
> The combination of some data and an aching desire for an answer does not ensure that a reasonable answer can be extracted from a given body of data... no matter how big the data are
